🛠️ironmunge is a save manager for Paradox Interactive's [Crusader Kings II](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/crusader-kings-ii/CKCK02GSK-MASTER.html).

🛠️ironmunge monitors your save game folder for new saves and stores them in a timeline as you play. You can roll back to a previous save, switch between past and future saves, or play through multiple diverging timelines within the same save.
